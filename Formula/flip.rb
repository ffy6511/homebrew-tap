# Homebrew formula for flip.
#
# This file lives in the flip repo as the source of truth. To publish via a
# tap, create a separate repo named `homebrew-tap` under the same GitHub
# account and copy this file to `<homebrew-tap>/Formula/flip.rb`. Users then
# install with:
#
#   brew tap ffy6511/tap
#   brew install flip
#
# When releasing a new version: tag the flip repo (e.g. v0.2.0), push the
# tag to trigger a GitHub Release with a source tarball, then update the
# `version` and `sha256` below (recompute with `shasum -a 256` on the
# tarball URL: `curl -sL <url> | shasum -a 256`).
