# Homebrew formula for flip.
#
# The flip repo renders this formula with scripts/build_formula.sh. A tag push
# runs .github/workflows/update-homebrew-tap.yml, computes the source tarball
# sha256, and publishes the rendered file to ffy6511/homebrew-tap.
#
# Users install the published formula with:
#
#   brew tap ffy6511/tap
#   brew install flip
#
# Release entrypoint: bump pyproject.toml, merge the release commit, then push
# a version tag such as v0.2.0. Manual tap edits are limited to one-off repairs
# when the workflow cannot publish.
